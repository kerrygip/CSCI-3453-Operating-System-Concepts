MASS STORAGE STRUCTURE

	- There are many types of mass storage and are called non volatile storage (NVS)
	- Particular ones lilke HDDs or NVM devices are specified 
	- The bulk of secondary storage are called Hard Disk Drives(HDD) and NonVolatile Memory (NVM)


	- HARD DRIVES
		- Disk drives contain one or more disks and we can store data on both sides
		- Divided into circular tracks and tracks are divided into sectors 
		- There are read/write heads which read and write to and from the disk
		- Head can rotate 60-250 times per second (RPM)
		- Rotation speed relates to transfer rate
			- Transfer rate is rate that data flows between drive and comp
		- We can think of disk drive as one dimensional arrays of logical blocks
		- Logical block is mapped into sectors of disks sequentially by the OS

	DISK SCHEDULING
		- OS is responsible for using hardware efficiently
			- For disk drives, this means fast access time and disk bandwidth 
		- Minimize seek time
			- Seek time = seek distance
		- Disk bandwidth is the total number of bytes transferred/ total number of time 
			between first request for service and completion of last transfer 
		- Many sources of disk I/O requests
			- OS, System Processes, User processes 
			- I/O Requests include input/output mode, disk/memory address and 
				number of sectors to transfer
			- OS maintains queue of requests per disk or device
			- Idle disk can immediately work on I/O requests
			- Busy disk means work must queue
				- Optimization algorithms only make sense when a queue exists 
			- Drive controllers have small buffers and can manage a queue of I/O requests 
				of varying depth
			- Several algorithms exist to schedule servicing of disk I/O requests
			- Analysis is true for one or many platters
			- Illustrate scheduling algorithms with a request queue with track number 
				between 0-199


	- SHORTEST SEEK TIME FIRST (SSTF)
		- requests the minimum seek time from current head position
		- SSTF is a form of SJF scheduling and can cause starvation

	- SCAN
		- The disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves toward the other end
			Servicing requests until it gets to the other end of hte disk where head 
			movement is reversed and servicing continues
		- SCAN ALGORITHM is somtimes called the elevator algorithm
		- Largest density at other end of the disk wait the longest 

	- CSCAN
		- Provides a more uniform wait time than SCAN
		- Head moves from one end of the disk to the other, servicing as it goes 
			- When it reaches the other end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the 
			disk, without serving any requests on the return trip
		- Treats the cylinders as a circular list that wraps around from last cylinder to first
	- CLOOK
		- Version of CSCAN
		- Arm only goes as far as the last request in each direction, then reverses direction
		immediately wtihout first going all the way to the end of the disk
